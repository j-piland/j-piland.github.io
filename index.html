      <h1>J. Piland</h1>
<p>
  My work lives at the intersection of computer vision, anomaly detection, and AI trustworthiness: I like
  taking messy, high-stakes real-world problems and turning them into models that are both effective and understandable.
  Along the way, I’ve bounced from network-based analyses in computational biology (proteins, folding, and structure) to
  modern deep learning where the “data” can be as slippery as synthetic media.
</p>

<p>
  Lately, I’ve been focused on <strong>synthetic face detection</strong> and building detectors that don’t just memorize artifacts
  but actually <em>pay attention</em> to the right signals. In recent work, I explore ideas like entropy-guided training to improve model focus and non-generative, energy-based approaches that offer a different
  lens on what a model believes (and how confident it is). If you’re into trustworthy AI, detecting generated content,
  and stress-testing models against clever fakes, we’ll probably get along.
</p>

<p>
  I’m always excited about work that connect theory to practice: safer spoofing detection, more understandable evaluation protocols, and applying network thinking to new domains. If you’re curious, check out my CV and publication list,
  and feel free to reach out.
